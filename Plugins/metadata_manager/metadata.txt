about=Metadata Manager is a QGIS plugin that simplifies the process of creating and managing layer metadata following QGIS metadata standards. It provides a 4-step guided wizard for metadata creation (Essential, Common, Optional, Review), with support for contacts, links, keywords, and comprehensive metadata fields. Features automatic save/load from database cache, completeness tracking, and integration with inventory databases created by the Inventory Miner tool. All persistent data is stored in a unified GeoPackage database with automatic version tracking and schema upgrades. Perfect for data managers who need to create comprehensive metadata for large collections of geospatial data.
