about=Metadata Manager is a QGIS plugin that simplifies the process of creating and managing layer metadata following QGIS metadata standards. It provides a guided wizard for metadata creation, libraries for reusable components (organizations, contacts, keywords), template system for bulk application, and integration with inventory databases created by the Inventory Miner tool. All persistent data is stored in a user-selected metadatamanager.gpkg GeoPackage database with automatic version tracking and schema upgrades. Supports exporting to QGIS XML format and direct association with GeoPackage layers. Perfect for data managers who need to create comprehensive metadata for large collections of geospatial data.
