## Current Status

**Version**: 0.2.0 (moving to 0.3.0)
**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Phase**: Phase 3 (Metadata Wizard) - Step 1 implemented

## What's Ready to Test

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Database Architecture (COMPLETE)
- Database connection and validation
- Table initialization
- Schema versioning
- Migration framework

### ✅ Phase 2: Metadata Quality Dashboard (COMPLETE)
- Overall statistics with progress bar
- Four drill-down views (Directory, Data Type, Format, CRS)
- Priority recommendations
- Refresh functionality

### 🧪 Phase 3: Metadata Wizard - Step 1 (TESTING)
- Progressive disclosure interface
- Step 1: Essential fields
  - Title (required)
  - Abstract (required, min 10 characters)
  - Keywords (tag input with add/remove)
  - Category (required dropdown)
- Navigation (Next/Previous/Skip)
- Validation with error messages
- Tab-based interface (Dashboard + Metadata Editor)

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. ✅ Plugin installed (run `install.bat` if needed)
2. ✅ QGIS restarted
3. ✅ Plugin enabled in Plugin Manager
4. ✅ Inventory database selected

### Testing Steps

1. **Open the plugin**
   - Click Metadata Manager toolbar button
   - Should see two tabs: "Dashboard" and "Metadata Editor"

2. **Switch to Metadata Editor tab**
   - Click "Metadata Editor" tab
   - Should see wizard interface with Step 1

3. **Follow the testing guide**
   - See: `docs/metadata_manager/testing/WIZARD_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
   - Complete all 10 test scenarios
   - Note any issues or suggestions

### Quick Verification Test

**5-Minute Smoke Test:**

1. Open Metadata Manager plugin ✓
2. Click "Metadata Editor" tab ✓
3. Try to click "Next →" with empty fields ✓
   - Should show validation errors
4. Fill in:
   - Title: "Test Layer"
   - Abstract: "This is a test abstract with more than ten characters"
   - Keywords: Add "test", "sample"
   - Category: Select "Transportation"
5. Click "Next →" ✓
   - Should advance to Step 2 placeholder
6. Click "← Previous" ✓
   - Should return to Step 1 with data preserved
7. Click "Save" ✓
   - Should show "No layer selected" message (expected)

If all 7 steps work, basic functionality is good! ✅

## What's NOT Yet Implemented

### ⏳ Step 1 Limitations
- No autocomplete for keywords
- No layer selection (shows "No layer selected")
- Save doesn't persist to database yet
- No load from existing metadata
- No draft auto-save

### ⏳ Steps 2-4 Not Built
- Step 2: Common fields (contacts, license, constraints)
- Step 3: Optional fields (lineage, links)
- Step 4: Review & save
- All show placeholder text

### ⏳ Phase 4 Not Started
- Smart defaults from inventory
- Auto-population of fields

### ⏳ Phase 5 Not Started
- Layer list panel
- Layer selection
- Bulk operations

## Known Issues (Expected)

1. **"No layer selected" on save** - Expected, Phase 5 will add layer selection
2. **Data doesn't persist** - Expected, database save not yet implemented
3. **Steps 2-4 are placeholders** - Expected, will be built next
4. **No autocomplete** - Expected, refinement feature

## Testing Documentation

All testing docs in `docs/metadata_manager/testing/`:

1. **WIZARD_TESTING_GUIDE.md** - Complete testing procedures
2. **test_wizard_basic.py** - Structural verification (✅ passed)
3. **README.md** - General testing guide

## Feedback Needed

### Critical Questions
1. Does Step 1 appear and function correctly?
2. Can you navigate between steps?
3. Does validation work as expected?
4. Are error messages helpful?
5. Can you add/remove keywords?

### UX Questions
1. Is the interface intuitive?
2. Are the fields appropriately sized?
3. Do the buttons make sense?
4. Is anything confusing or unclear?
5. What would you change?

## Reporting Issues

### For Bugs
Include:
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots if possible
- QGIS message log errors

### For Suggestions
Include:
- What you tried to do
- What was difficult or confusing
- How you'd prefer it to work
- Priority (critical/nice-to-have)

## Next Steps Based on Testing

### If Testing Goes Well ✅
Continue Phase 3:
1. Implement Step 2 (contacts, license, constraints)
2. Implement Step 3 (lineage, links)
3. Implement Step 4 (review & save)
4. Add database save/load
5. Test complete wizard flow

### If Issues Found ⚠️
Fix before continuing:
1. Address critical bugs
2. Refine Step 1 UX
3. Add missing features
4. Retest Step 1
5. Then continue to Steps 2-4

### If Major Problems 🚫
Redesign approach:
1. Gather detailed feedback
2. Consider alternative UI design
3. Simplify or restructure
4. Prototype new approach
5. Test again

## Installation Check

Verify these files exist in your plugin directory:

```
C:\Users\br8kw\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\AdvancedUser\python\plugins\metadatamanager\

├── db\
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── manager.py
│   ├── migrations.py
│   └── schema.py
├── widgets\
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── dashboard_widget.py
│   └── metadata_wizard.py  ← NEW!
├── MetadataManager.py
├── MetadataManager_dockwidget.py  ← UPDATED!
└── metadata.txt
```

If `metadata_wizard.py` is missing, run `install.bat` again.

## Success Criteria for Step 1

Step 1 is considered successful if:

- ✅ Interface loads without errors
- ✅ All fields accept input
- ✅ Validation prevents invalid progression
- ✅ Valid data allows progression
- ✅ Navigation works (Next/Previous/Skip)
- ✅ Keywords can be added and removed
- ✅ Error messages are clear and helpful
- ✅ No crashes or freezes
- ✅ User can understand what to do
- ✅ Overall experience is positive

If 8+ criteria met → Continue to Steps 2-4
If 5-7 met → Refine Step 1 first
If <5 met → Redesign needed
